FIFA 2002 Sui's Fix
===========================================

This is a dsound.dll wrapper originally wrote by OrfeasZ, rewritten by me, in order to fix the code crashing the game on modern CPUs, due to the game setting a value it divides with to 0.

In case of issues (like flags swinging to fast etc.) try adjusting the value in dsound.cfg (lower causes the elements to be faster).
